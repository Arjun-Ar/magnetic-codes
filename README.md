Codes on Magnetism and related stuff
Disclaimer
I am not a professional coder. I am a PhD Scholar trying to learn coding on my own. The codes which you will find here may not be
the most efficient or easiest one, but it is the one I have come up with. With my limited knowledge in codeing, I have tried to
simulate some physical problems.

If you find any of these codes useful, let me know. 

Cheers!
